            <h2>Reinventing Paper</h2>
            <p> Imagine if you could fit a computer keyboard, piano, and video game controller in the fold of your
                pocket. Using paper electronics, a seemingly ordinary piece of paper can be transformed into a piece of
                powerful technology. Users are able to input information such as letters, numbers, action buttons, and
                music notes using paper keys which are activated by the friction of the user’s fingers tapping on the
                paper. The friction between the user’s fingers creates electric static that is carried through a circuit
                on the back of the paper which attaches to a bluetooth microchip. This bluetooth microchip is the brain
                of the paper keyboard and acts as the control unit, ALU, and memory. The microchip’s ALU calculates and
                processes the electric static emitted by the user as they are tapping. The pattern and order in which
                the electric signals occur is stored on the microchip’s memory and then acts as a control unit by
                sending a signal to a computer which executes the instructions. The signal’s output is text, sounds from
                music notes, and movement on the computer screen from the action buttons on the paper keyboard. </p>
