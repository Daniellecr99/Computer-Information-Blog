            <h2>Reinventing Paper</h2>
            <p> Imagine if you could fit a computer keyboard, piano, and video game controller in the fold of your
                pocket. Using paper electronics, a seemingly ordinary piece of paper can be transformed into a piece of
                powerful technology. Users are able to input information such as letters, numbers, action buttons, and
                music notes using paper keys which are activated by the friction of the user’s fingers tapping on the
                paper. The friction between the user’s fingers creates electric static that is carried through a circuit
                on the back of the paper which attaches to a bluetooth microchip. This bluetooth microchip is the brain
                of the paper keyboard and acts as the control unit, ALU, and memory. The microchip’s ALU calculates and
                processes the electric static emitted by the user as they are tapping. The pattern and order in which
                the electric signals occur is stored on the microchip’s memory and then acts as a control unit by
                sending a signal to a computer which executes the instructions. The signal’s output is text, sounds from
                music notes, and movement on the computer screen from the action buttons on the paper keyboard. </p>

            <h3>Chromebook vs. HP Pavilion</h3>
            <p>The HP Pavilion and Google Chromebook are two very popular and powerful computers to consider buying
                when looking for a laptop. But which one is better for someone interested in music and video editing?
                Chromebook is an affordable laptop designed by Google which runs on the operating system Chrome OS.
                Chromebook works very fast and offers 100gb of cloud storage which is perfect for videographers who need
                the extra space for their projects. With the chromebook's high quality and high resolution touchscreen,
                creative individuals can easily interact and touch up their projects. Youtube is featured as an app on
                the Google chromebook which offers a more updated and secure access to musicians and videographers who
                are interested in sharing their work.
                One of the main disadvantages with Chromebook is its inability to run Windows programs. This can be very
                limiting for people who are not familiar with google programs and prefer using Internet Explorer or
                Firefox. On the other hand HP Pavilion is compatible with all browsers including Google chrome. This is
                a huge
                benefit for someone who is interested in versatility and the ability to use a wide range of programs.
                Although the hp pavilion is less simplistic looking at first glance, its controls and mousepad is
                personally much easier to navigate. Despite chromebook's high capacity cloud storage, the local storage
                is limited to 32gb of local storage, whereas HP Pavilion can store over 500gb of data.
                HP Pavilion also offers users the ability to edit video offline while chromebook relies heavily on
                online programs. This is extremely helpful for people who need to work on the go or have a slow internet
                connection. Additionally HP Pavilion offers a wide variety of editing programs including iMovie, Windows
                Movie maker, and Premiere Elements.
                With all things considered, I would personally recommend HP Pavilion over Google Chromebook to someone
                interested in music video editing although there are still many benefits to the Chromebook.

            <h3> Imapact of ISP</h3>
            <p>Internet Service Providers provide a very reliable and effective way for people to access the internet.
                Many Internet Service Providers act as a middleman by using cables and wires to get internet service
                from point A to point B. Without the help of ISP’s many people, especially low income, wouldn’t have the
                advantage of accessing the internet from the comfort of their own home or business. Before the age of
                ISP’s, computer users had to rely on universities or government agencies to connect to the internet.
                Making the internet more available to society has transformed the way people communicate, access
                information, acquire opportunities, and perform everyday tasks. Some very popular ISPs are Comcast,
                Centurylink, AT&T, Sparklight, and Verizon. With the rise of ISPs, many providers have started offering
                discounts for low income families, making internet access more feasible and affordable than ever before.
